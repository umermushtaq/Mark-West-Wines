				<h2>Links To Other Websites</h2>
				<p>On this Site, we may provide as a convenience to you links to other websites, including sites operated by us, our partners, associates, or independent third parties. These links are provided as a convenience to you. Each website has its own privacy practices, as described in that site's privacy policy. Those practices may be different than the practices described herein, and we urge you to read each website's privacy policy carefully before you use or submit information to that site. Additionally, to the extent that you follow a link to a website operated by an independent third party, please be aware that we exercise no authority or control over that third party, and cannot and are not responsible for any information that you may submit at that site.</p>
				<h2>Where Do We Store And How Do We Secure Your Personal Information</h2>
				<p>Your Personal Information will be kept in a database held on servers kept in a physically and technologically secure environment located in the U.S.A., accessed only by authorized personnel or contractors who are bound to keep your information confidential. Any transmission of your credit card information will be encrypted. We have in place procedures for training our employees about their obligations under this Privacy Policy, disciplining them for failure to follow this Policy. We also have in place internal procedures to confirm general company compliance with this Policy.</p>
				<p>Your information will be transferred to CB, located in the U.S.A., which location may be outside of your own country, and by providing us with your information, you are consenting to such transfer. Although we will use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of any Personal Information collected, we will not be liable for disclosure of Personal Information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.</p>

				<h2>No Data Collected from Children</h2>
				<p>Our Site is not directed at children and cannot be accessed by persons who do not verify that they are of legal drinking age. As a result, we will not knowingly collect information from minors in the U.S. with or without consent from their parents or guardians.</p>
				<h2>Cookies</h2>
				<p>When you visit this Site, we leave a "Cookie" in the memory of your Web browser. The site will only function properly if Cookies are enabled. Svedka.com uses persistent Cookies to authenticate you as a user and display content that is relevant and specific to you. Cookies are very small files that store information about your visit to and use of this Site. Most major commercial Internet sites use them and they make your Internet-surfing more useful and less time-consuming for you because they store information that is reusable each time you visit this Site, such as birthday and other preferences you have chosen to share with us. Cookies cannot access and read the files on your hard drive and cannot be used as a virus. They do allow us to provide information and products that are more meaningful to you without asking you the same questions every time you visit us. You may get Cookies from our advertisers. We cannot pre-screen these Cookies since they come directly to you from other sites. We hope you will want the better service that Cookies allow, but if you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse Cookies. However by doing that, you will not be able to access certain areas of svedka.com. To enable and disable Cookies, please consult your internet browser's help menu.</p>
				<p><strong>We reserve the right to change or update this Policy at any time by posting a notice that we are changing our Privacy Policy or by sending an e-mail message to previously registered visitors.</strong></p>
				<h2>What To Do If You Have Questions Or Concerns About Your Information, Or If You Need To Contact Us</h2>
				<p>If you need information or have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our use of your Personal Information, or wish to review all of your Personal Information, you may contact our IT Department via e-mail at <a href="mailto:customerservice@cbrands.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Contact Us', 'Offsite Link', 'Email Us']);">customerservice@cbrands.com</a>, via mail 235 N.

				<p>In order to facilitate the transfer of data between the U.S. and EU countries, the U.S. and the EU have entered into a "safe harbor program," under which data can be transferred from the EU to participating non-EU companies. The program has a set of seven principles, to which CB complies with respect to the data collected and used as described in this Privacy Policy. As part of that program, while we strive to respond to your concerns, we recognize that we may not always answer all of your questions, and as such if you are an EU resident, we will participate with the Data Protection Authority in the country in which you reside. Thus to the extent that you feel that your questions have not been answered, and you are a resident of an EU Member country, you should feel free to contact the Data Protection Authority of the country in which you reside.</p>
